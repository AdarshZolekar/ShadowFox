3) *Intermediate Level*: Your task is to develop an ML model for car selling price prediction and analysis. The deployed system will provide users with an approximate selling price for their cars based on several features, including fuel type, years of service, showroom price, number of previous owners, kilometers driven, whether the seller is a dealer or an individual and transmission type (manual/automatic).

4) *Advanced Level*:  Implement and analyze a Language Model (LM) of your choice (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, or a domain-specific model) in a Jupyter Notebook. Demonstrate setup, key parameters and performance on sample text. Explore its context understanding, generation quality and adaptability through experiments. Formulate research questions on its strengths and limitations, support findings with visualizations and ensure ethical alignment. Conclude with insights, applications and improvement areas within NLP and ML.
